Overview:
CommerceApp Budget application. How do I work on this project with others?
Create an account on github. Create a Fork (upper right) of Toonlink8101's project. The fork will make a new repository in your own profile. You can then use Git to clone the project down to your machine (or edit content directly in Github). When you have content that you want part of the overall project, click Sync Fork and create a pull request. Toonlink8101 will workthrough and merge the content in to the Main branch.

Change Log:
